## Use Case

### Problem Statement
Natural disasters such as earthquakes and extreme temperature fluctuations can cause significant harm to communities, often with little to no warning. There is a need for a reliable, real-time monitoring system that can alert individuals and authorities promptly, allowing for quicker response times and potentially saving lives.

### Solution
Ton-Tector addresses this problem by combining advanced sensor technology with the reliability of blockchain. It continuously monitors environmental conditions and immediately alerts users to any anomalies via a Telegram mini-app. Additionally, by functioning as a lightweight node on the TON blockchain, it ensures data integrity and leverages the decentralized nature of the network for robustness and security.

### How It Works
1. **Sensor Monitoring:** Ton-Tector uses DHT22 sensors for temperature detection and ADXL345 accelerometers for seismic activity monitoring.
2. **Data Processing:** The Raspberry Pi 4 processes the sensor data and determines if the readings indicate a potential natural disaster.
3. **Blockchain Integration:** The processed data is then logged on the TON blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.
4. **Real-Time Alerts:** If a potential natural disaster is detected, the device sends an immediate alert to users via a Telegram mini-app.
5. **User Interaction:** Users can subscribe to the Telegram bot to receive real-time updates and alerts directly on their mobile devices.

### Detailed Workflow
1. **Sensor Data Collection**:
    - The `DHT22` sensor measures temperature and the `ADXL345` sensor detects seismic activity.
    - Sensor data is read by Python scripts running on the Raspberry Pi.

2. **Data Processing**:
    - The collected data is analyzed to identify significant deviations indicating potential natural disasters.
    - Processed data is logged locally and prepared for blockchain entry.

3. **Blockchain Integration**:
    - Data is sent to the TON blockchain node software on the Raspberry Pi.
    - The node validates and logs the data, ensuring immutability and transparency.

4. **Real-Time Alerts**:
    - The Flask application interacts with the Telegram Bot API.
    - When abnormal sensor data is detected, an alert is sent through the Telegram bot to all subscribed users.

5. **User Interaction**:
    - Users subscribe to the bot via Telegram to receive updates.
    - The bot provides real-time alerts and status updates on environmental conditions.
